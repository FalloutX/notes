# Notes Index.

__To the Reader__: These are unapologetically my notes. These were made for personal use, but opened for someone who may see a value in the matter presented. Keep in mind that there can be some spelling mistakes as well as some errors in the notes. If you find any mistakes, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/FalloutX/notes/issues).

__Why?__: This is currently the best way I know how to manage my notes. The `Search` in top bar is very handy.
